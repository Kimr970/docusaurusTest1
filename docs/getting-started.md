## Step 1: Generate a new Faction customer request through our Portal

If you haven't already, generate a new Request on Faction Portal using the classic template-this entire line changed:

```shell
npx @docusaurus/init@latest init my-website classic
```

## Step 2: Start your VM Instance

Run the development server in the newly created `my-website` folder:

```shell
cd my-website

npx docusaurus start
```

Open `docs/getting-started.md` and edit some lines. The site reloads automatically and display your changes.

<img
  src={require('/static/img/analytics_pic.png').default}
  alt="Example banner"
/>

## That's it!

Congratulations! You've successfully run and modified your Docusaurus project.
